                <h1>About Sam</h1>
                <strong><small>This is where my software engineer journey begins:</small></strong>
                <p>Started my career journey in sales. I have been a sales representative for multiple large companies in the past most recent was DocuSign, where I was a Market Development Representative for Healthcare and Life Science in the small to medium size business market. I did enjoy sales a lot since I got to use my interpersonal skills with the individuals I got to speak with and help with the different workflow issues that they would encounter daily. But with sales, there are a lot of peaks and valleys, which were on a person after a while, and after I had been laid off from DocuSign, I thought now would be a good time for a career change. I saw an old colleague update their LinkedIn with Coding Temple, which piqued my interest. Shortly after that, I signed up for the Software Engineering Bootcamp since I have always been interested in coding and interested in learning how everything works together.</p>
